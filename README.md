# d3-dashboard-solo

This was originally for a university CPSC course group project where each member was required to make their own version of a dashboard using an agreed-upon dataset for the initial phase of the project. Please refer to my "d3-dashboard-team" repo for the final submitted rendition with added interactivity between and within the charts.

Please see github pages deployment to view project: https://lawrencemanzano5.github.io/d3-dashboard-solo/
